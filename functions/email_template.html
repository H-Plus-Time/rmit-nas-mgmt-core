<p>
  As part of our Food Deals initiative, we're inviting you to head over to 
  <a href="https://nas-app.firebaseapp.com">Food Deals RMIT</a>, and create a profile.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="https://nas-app.firebaseapp.com">Food Deals RMIT</a></li>
  <li>Sign up with the email you previously provided to us ({{=it.email}}).</li>
  <li>Click on the Profile tab</li>
  <li>Hit edit and fill out the form as best you can (you can update this later). At a 
    minimum, we require your company/trading name, address, tagline and 
    detail/description and logo.
  </li>
  <li>For the banner and menu images, we require that images be no larger than 3MB, and
    in either png or jpg. The app displays these in portrait (aspect ratios of 2:1 and 
    2:1.4 respectively); the image preview gives you a rough idea of how your images
    will be displayed - its a good idea to experiment with crop options and 
    try them in the form, to avoid unexpected letterboxing.</li>
  <li>Hit Save</li>
</ul>

<p>The offers page (via the tabs at the top) lets you create offers for specific times,
  which users can interact with in one of two ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Browse Offers in the RMIT Food Deals app.</li>
  <li>If a user has liked your profile, they'll receive push notifications (the same sort 
  that pop up from your email, calendar apps) up to one hour before the offer or 
  immediately, whichever is earliest.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Users won't see either the notification or the offer until its actually valid, so you
  can create a bunch of these in advance - useful for those busy trading hours.
